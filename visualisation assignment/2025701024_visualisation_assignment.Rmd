# So , when I initially plotted the histograms , I could see how different the
# distribution was . I was the summary function to see the mean , median , min,
# max value , that's when I saw that they were the same for each of the groups. 
# So, that would mean that if a drew a boxplot , it would be the same for each 
# group and so was the case . Finally , I plotted the violin + boxplot to show 
# how different the distribution were with the same box plots. This is what I 
# think was the deception . I pivoted the dataframe (sheet) longer for 
# flexibility while plotting using ggplot() functions . I have Adam Dede's 
# udemy course on statistics using R , where they use similar strategies for 
# plotting data.
